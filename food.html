    <h1> EKPANG NKUKWO</h1>
    <br>
      <p>Ekpang Nkukwo is a Nigerian native food common to the south south eastern parts of Nigeria, the Akwa Ibom and Cross river States of Nigeria. This special food is mostly prepared for special occasions such as traditional marriage.</p>
      <p>Ekpang Nkukwo is rich in carbohydrate, protein, fat and oil, vitamins and minerals. Probably, why the process of cooking it consumes much time and energy (Joking).</p>
      <p>Due to the long and tedious process of preparation, it is usually prepared with the help of other family members. Ekpang Nkukwo is best enjoyed hot and eaten with the hand. I wont forget to add in a cool environment (smile).</p>
